A powerful form of machine learning that enables computers to solve perceptual problems such as image and speech recognition is increasingly making an entry into the biological sciences. These deep-learning methods, such as deep artificial neural networks, use multiple processing layers to discover patterns and structure in very large data sets. Each layer learns a concept from the data that subsequent layers build on; the higher the level, the more abstract the concepts that are learned. Deep learning does not depend on prior data processing and automatically extracts features. To use a simple example, a deep neural network tasked with interpreting shapes would learn to recognize simple edges in the first layer and then add recognition of the more complex shapes composed of those edges in subsequent layers. There is no hard and fast rule for how many layers are needed to constitute deep learning, but most experts agree that more than two are required.
